# Data Science and Machine Learning

Here is a repository of all the example Data Science and Machine Learning Projects I have worked on and/or am currently working on. My intention is for this to grow overtime and to showcase my skills and how they have grown overtime. I hope to cover a range of data science and machine learning technologies in this repo.

## Repository Structure
1) [Competitions](https://github.com/jimmybunter01/Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning/tree/main/Competitions) - this holds the files (e.g. notebooks and code) related to the various data science competition e.g. Kaggle that I participate in.
2) [Projects](https://github.com/jimmybunter01/Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning/tree/main/Projects) - this holds various projects I have worked on to expand my data science and machine learning knowledge.
